#Question:
#With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i)
#such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included).
#and then the program should print the dictionary.

n = int(input("Wpisz liczbÄ™: "))
dict = {}

for i in range(1, n+1):
    dict[i] = i*i
print(dict)
